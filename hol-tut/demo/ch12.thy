  Simple proofs:

  Command 'lemma' / 'theorem': state a proposition
  Attribute 'simp': use this theorem as a simplification rule in future proofs
  Method 'induct': structural induction
  Method 'auto':  automatic proof (mostly by simplification)
  Command 'done':  end of proof

lemma app_Nil2[simp]: "app xs Nil = xs"
apply (induct xs)
apply auto
done

lemma app_assoc[simp]: "app (app xs ys) zs = app xs (app ys zs)"
apply (induct xs)
apply auto
done

lemma rev_app[simp]: "rev (app xs ys) = app (rev ys) (rev xs)"

theorem rev_rev[simp]: "rev (rev xs) = xs"

(* Hint for demo:
   do the proof top down, discovering the lemmas one by one,
   as described in LNCS2283.
